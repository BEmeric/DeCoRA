	Because of adding of new barcode (IonCode), computing of CNV has failed. So we made DeCoRA be able to recognize this barcode.
	In the case the barcode was not detected, DeCoRA takes the full name of bam file. Thus we will fix it if this case appear.

A DeCoRA standalone version was created and adapted for illumina data : DeCoRA_StandAlone_BE_20170524.py
Don't use it on the pgm server.

================

	- gene.py => gene_BE_20170601.py
Some exons are not covered so we compute depth coverage like this: total_depth) / length_gene
So in the code for these exons not covered it is impossible to compute 0 / 0, thus in this case we consider 0 / 1 for depth coverage computing.

DeCoRA(v1.0.3) version was not changed.
